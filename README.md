# HouseCS
A complete port of my Java console app "House". (Teaching myself C#)
(Will sometimes be behind or ahead in terms of updates, but this will be corrected eventually.)

## Compile
Q: Hey, it didn't compile! Something about a file called ItemImport.cs  
A: Rename ItemImport.example to ItemImport.cs (You don't need to know what kind of things are in my home!)
